<h1>Hipsters</h1>
<p class="Harsh">By Harsh Patel</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2000s,[8] being derived from earlier movements in the 1940s.[citation needed] Members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture"<FONT SIZE = 10>subculture</FONT SIZE></a> do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is overly trendy or effete.[9][6] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.[10]</p>



<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>

<p>Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]". Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar eraâ€”beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", reinventing it "with a winking inauthenticity." Lorentzen says that hipsters are mostly white 18- to 34-year old people. In a Huffington Post article entitled "Who's a Hipster?", Julia Plevin argues that the "definition of 'hipster' remains opaque to anyone outside this self-proclaiming, highly-selective circle." In Rob Horning's April 2009 article "The Death of the Hipster" in PopMatters, he states that the hipster might be the "embodiment of postmodernism as a spent force, revealing what happens when pastiche and irony exhaust themselves as aesthetics." In a New York Times editorial, Mark Greif states that the much-cited difficulty in analyzing the term stems from the fact that any attempt to do so provokes universal anxiety, since it "calls everyone's bluff".</p>
